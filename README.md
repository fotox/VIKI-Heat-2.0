## Overview

**V.I.K.I – Home Energy Management System (HEMS)** provides a centralized platform to monitor, control, and optimize heating and energy systems.
This part of the project focuses on the **hardware integration** — including temperature measurement, relay control, and power distribution — built around a **Raspberry Pi 4**.

The system interfaces with the **V.I.K.I – Heat** backend (Flask/Python) and frontend (React/TypeScript) to visualize sensor data and control outputs in real time.

---

## System Architecture

The hardware consists of several core modules:

- **Raspberry Pi 4** as the central controller
- **R4DCB08** module for Modbus-RTU communication with temperature sensors
- **3-way relay board** for controlling heating or auxiliary circuits
- **ABB F204 A** RCD (FI) and **ABB B16** circuit breakers for safety
- **Mean Well power supplies** for 5 V / 3 A (15 W) and 36 V / 1.5 A (36 W)
- **Heschen CT1-25** for current measurement or switching
- **DS18B20 temperature sensors** connected via the R4DCB08

All components are mounted inside a **three-row distribution cabinet**, powered by a **400 V / 64 A** main line.

Communication between the Raspberry Pi and the R4DCB08 occurs via a **USB–RS485 adapter** (Modbus RTU protocol).

## Installation & Wiring

Detailed schematics and wiring diagrams are provided in:

- `documentation/eplan.pdf` – Full electrical schematic
- `documentation/wiring.pdf` – Visual wiring diagram with component layout

### Summary

1. Mount all components inside a **three-row DIN-rail cabinet**.
2. Connect the **400 V feed** through the ABB F204 A FI and circuit breakers.
3. Wire the **Mean Well** power supplies to distribute 5 V / 36 V lines.
4. Connect the **Raspberry Pi 4** to:
   - R4DCB08 via **USB–RS485 adapter**
   - Relay board via **GPIO pins**
   - Power via the 5 V supply
5. Attach **temperature sensors** to the R4DCB08 according to the Modbus address mapping.
6. Verify wiring continuity and polarity before energizing the system.

> 🧠 **Note:** All RS485 and signal lines should be shielded to avoid interference.
> Keep high-voltage and low-voltage cables separated in the cabinet.

## Software Installation (Raspberry Pi)

After the wiring is complete, the Raspberry Pi must be prepared with the required libraries and runtime environment.

### 1. Install BCM2835 Library

The BCM2835 library is required for low-level GPIO access and relay control.

```bash
wget http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/bcm2835-1.71.tar.gz
tar zxvf bcm2835-1.71.tar.gz
cd bcm2835-1.71/
sudo ./configure && sudo make && sudo make check && sudo make install
```

More details are available on the official site:
http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/

### 2. Install Docker

Docker is used to run the backend and frontend containers for the V.I.K.I – Heat system.

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

After re-login, you can verify installation with:

```bash
docker --version
```
### 3. Install Required Python Libraries

The R4DCB08 temperature module requires pymodbus and pyserial.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-pymodbus python3-serial
```

Once completed, the system is ready to run the V.I.K.I Heat app or Docker containers.

### 4. Case & 3D Model

The V.I.K.I Heat hardware case consists of a base and lid printed in PETG (white + blue).
Alternatively, ABS or ASA may be used for higher temperature resistance.

- Mounting type: DIN-rail (inside electrical cabinet)
- Minimum cabinet size: 3 rows

3D and construction files:

- documentation/case.3mf – 3D model (print-ready)
- documentation/technical_map_case_base.pdf – Base plate construction plan
- documentation/technical_map_case_top.pdf – Top cover construction plan

### 5. First Start-Up Procedure

1. Connect the RJ-45 communication cable on the top side.
2. Switch on the FI and circuit breakers.
3. Boot the Raspberry Pi with the micro-SD containing the V.I.K.I – Heat image.
4. Ensure BCM2835 and Docker are correctly installed (see section above).
5. Access the web interface via your network using the Pi’s IP address on port 80.
6. Configure your household and heating parameters in the Settings section.
7. Verify temperature readings in the dashboard.

The system currently operates via Ethernet only.
WLAN functionality is planned for future revisions.

### 6. Testing the Temperature Sensors

There are two main ways to test the temperature readings:

#### Option 1 – Using the Frontend Dashboard

Sensor values appear on the dashboard under Heating → Temperature Sensors once the backend service is active.

#### Option 2 – Using the Shell Script

Run the provided Python script on the Raspberry Pi to verify Modbus readings manually:

```python
import time

from pymodbus.client import ModbusSerialClient as ModbusClient
from pymodbus.pdu import ModbusPDU

temp_sensors: dict = {
    "Sensor 1": {
      "binding": "buffer_tank_higher_sensor",
      "name": "Warmwasserspeicher Oben",
      "value": 0
    },
    "Sensor 2": {
      "binding": "buffer_tank_middle_sensor",
      "name": "Warmwasserspeicher Mitte",
      "value": 0
    },
    "Sensor 3": {
      "binding": "buffer_tank_upper_sensor",
      "name": "Warmwasserspeicher Unten",
      "value": 0
    },
    "Sensor 4": {
      "binding": "",
      "name": "Pufferspeicher Oben",
      "value": 0
    },
    "Sensor 5": {
      "binding": "",
      "name": "Pufferspeicher Mitte",
      "value": 0
    },
    "Sensor 6": {
      "binding": "",
      "name": "Pufferspeicher Unten",
      "value": 0
    }
}
client = ModbusClient(port='/dev/ttyS0', baudrate=9600, timeout=1, parity='N', stopbits=1, bytesize=8)

if not client.connect():
    print("No connection to R4DCB08 module.")
    print(temp_sensors)

try:
    response: ModbusPDU = client.read_holding_registers(0x0000, 8, slave=1)
    if not response.isError():
        temperatures: list[int] = response.registers
        for i, temp in enumerate(temperatures[:6]):
            if temp < 30000:
                temp_sensors['Sensor ' + str(i + 1)]['value'] = temp / 10.0
            else:
                temp_sensors['Sensor ' + str(i + 1)]['value'] = 0
        client.close()
        print(f"Read temperature sensors successfully. Values: {temp_sensors}")
        print(temp_sensors)

    else:
        print("Error by reading the R4DCB08 register.")
    time.sleep(2)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error by reading sensor: {e}")
```

You should see temperature values for all connected DS18B20 sensors printed to the terminal.

If no values appear, verify RS485 connections and Modbus addressing on the R4DCB08.

### 7. Safety Notes

⚠️ Electrical Safety Warning

This system operates at 400 V AC and must be installed only by a qualified electrician.
All wiring and installation of FI, circuit breakers, and power supplies must comply with local electrical regulations.

- Always disconnect power before wiring or service.
- Use appropriate wire gauges (1.5 mm² min for 230 V).
- Ensure all protective earth (PE) connections are continuous.
- Keep signal and power cables separated.

Improper installation can result in electric shock, fire, or equipment damage.
